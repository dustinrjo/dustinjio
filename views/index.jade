    h2 TL;DR
    p I started out as a video game hacker & hobbyist in the 90's and went on to officially study interactive design and new media theory through the SBCC SOMA program and USC's Institute of Multimedia Literacy program.

    p Over the past 10 years I've been hired by dozens of companies as a contract designer, animator, developer, and project lead.

    h2#section2 In 2008 I took a dive into startups

    p From 2008 to 2012, I worked on building a large technology platform for AST, a multi-million dollar video startup that I helped co-found.  Over the 4 year period that we built out our product, I lead the system architecture, managed user experience, and oversaw the implementation of front end user interfaces across multiple browsers and native apps for embedded devices.  Building this platform I directly recruited and managed 8 fulltime software developers.

      .img-div
        img(src='img/ast-stb.png')
      figcaption I assembled and lead the team developing an embedded Linux set top box.

    p Throughout this process I gained extensive experience working with video transcoding, embedded systems, distributed computing, and content schema design.

    p The platform I built transcodes massive volumes of HDTV source material into multi-bitrate HTTP Live Streaming delivered across multiple server and cloud platforms linked to a custom built content management system where international TV programmers can schedule shows to playout on channels, manage pricing for video on demand, and CRUD multi-language metadata.

    p This back end system connects to a TV set top box running on a software stack developed in house where users can channel flip through professionally created HDTV channels, view any and all content On Demand, and search or browse for thousands of titles.

      figcaption This is an early live demo of the first generation set top box platform.
    p When browser video technology started catching up to native apps, we quickly transitioned our front end to servicing multiple devices through a browser based UI sharing the same JSON APIs and providing users with the same channel flipping and video on demand experience.

    h1#section3 Project Lead
    p As a founding technology entrepreneur, I scaled a team of 2 up to nearly 20 fulltime employees with 13 direct reports.  I directly managed software engineers with all levels of technical experience ranging from very senior Chief Architects to college students.  I lead graphic design teams and recruited and trained interns. I oversaw everything from major releases requiring custom hardware deployment to quick marketing site updates.  For two years I managed relationships with clients overseas in Japan and Korea and managed offshore software developers in Europe.

      figcaption Some of the people I've managed over the years:

        img(src='img/sk.png', title='Jr. .Net Developer')
        img(src='img/is.png', title='Jr. Designer')
    p I’ve used most major project management tools ranging from Jira and Basecamp to Trello and MS Project. I build wireframes and design mock ups in the Adobe Creative Suite and have created both granular and high level documentation for projects ranging in length from days to years. I specialize in iterative development with short release cycles, but also jump at the opportunity to create painstakingly wellcrafted up front specifications for larger projects.

    p As an entrepreneur I gained mission critical experience managing budgets and deadlines, estimating costs, and adapting to complex situations in a rapidly changing environment. Although follow through and maximizing product quality are always key goals, I also have learned the immeasurable value of adapting plans quickly to take advantage of natural efficiencies and adding constraints to a project scope to achieve the highest value results.  As a hands on developer and participating in the architecture process, I can much more accurately estimate project timelines and resource requirements, evaluate team performance, and identify where negotiating a small change to a specification can result in huge cost savings.
